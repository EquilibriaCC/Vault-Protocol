Abstract. A single-chain, dual-coin, peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that gives users
the ability to burn and destroy a primary coin with volatile value in order to mint and create
an equivalent US dollar value of a secondary coin could result in a stable US dollar pegged
secondary coin if these mint and burn mechanisms also ran in the reverse allowing stablecoin
redemption for any amount of volatile coin necessary to restore the same market value. Such
market conversion rates would be observed by a decentralized oracle monitored by
user-hosted service nodes calibrated to reduce the likelihood of black swan failure events.
Thus, this concept of market-driven mint and burn could be used to take the volatile
cryptocurrency Triton (XTRI) and use it to collateralize the US dollar-pegged value of a
second currency on the same blockchain: the Sao Dollar (SAO). While the mint and burn
concept was first proposed by Haven Protocol in early 2018, Haven is closed source, has yet
to be implemented, and is not overseen by user-validated nodes. Triton will provide the first
open-source alternative for a mint and burn stablecoin and will use community feedback
during a testnet period to ensure the robustness of the Triton oracle, Triton service nodes, and
the XTRI / SAO mint and burn implementation. In this document, we outline the history of
stablecoins, the unique challenges we see with mint and burn as a system, and our initial
attempts to outline our oracle, service nodes, and mint and burn implementation.
